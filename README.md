Answers to the questions posed in Module 8

    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? 
    Writing efficient code and storing information in various data types. Use big O notation to calculate worst case senarios
    
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    Trial and error + research helped me to understand that choosing the appropriate data container regardless of how small the program is
    being efficient always matters.
    
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    Stack Overflow, google, cpp help in addition to reading other student posts.
    
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    I look at writing efficent code in a new light. Regardless of program size, efficency matters.
    
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    I learned how important comments and white space makes the code easier to read & understand.
